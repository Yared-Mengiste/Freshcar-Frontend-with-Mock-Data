# 🛒 FreshCart Frontend

**FreshCart** is a full-featured grocery delivery web application frontend built with **React.js**. It connects users to nearby supermarkets offering fresh plant- and animal-based products like fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy. The frontend enables both customer and admin interactions such as ordering, managing products, and tracking deliveries.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** — frontend library
- **React Router** — page routing
- **Context API** — for global state management (user, cart, search, and product data)
- **Axios** — for HTTP requests
- **React Icons / Ionicons** — for visual elements
- **CSS Modules** — component styling
- **Vite** — fast development server and build tool
